This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I followed the Frontend Masters [tutorial](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/fullstack-app-next-v2/) to create this project manager. It is a work in progress. I am aiming to improve the styling, add back-end connectivity for task related requests, remove custom built in lag time, and sign out features.
